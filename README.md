# Sign & Spell VR

## Overview
Sign Spell VR is an immersive virtual reality application designed to make learning Irish Sign Language (ISL) interactive and accessible for beginners and educators. Built using the Meta Quest 3 headset and the Godot 4 game engine, the project combines real-time hand tracking with gamified lessons to help users master the ISL alphabet, common words, phrases, and simple sentence construction in a 3D VR environment.​

## Project Goals
- Facilitate hands-on ISL learning in a way that simulates real practice, going beyond passive video tutorials or textbook study.
- Provide real-time feedback to correct and guide users on signing accuracy, increasing engagement and learning outcomes.
-Promote accessible communication and inclusion, addressing the lack of ISL-focused digital learning tools.

## Key Features
- **ISL Learning Modules:** Progressive lessons covering the ISL alphabet, common vocabulary, and basic sentences.
- **Hand Tracking:** Uses Meta Quest 3’s hand tracking sensors for intuitive gesture recognition, tailored to individual users through calibration.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Visual and textual feedback on the accuracy of signed gestures, reinforcing correct signs and suggesting improvements.
- **User Progress Tracking:** Saves user calibration and progress locally in JSON files, with future potential for cloud sync.
- **VR User Interface:** Designed for ease-of-use in VR, including large buttons, simple menus, and an onboarding tutorial for first-time users.
- **Assessment Tools:** Interactive testing modules to evaluate comprehension and retention, with the ability to revisit earlier lessons.

## Technology Stack
- **VR Platform:** Meta Quest 3/3S for hand tracking and portability.
- **Game Engine:** Godot 4, chosen for its open source nature and strong educational community.
- **Programming:** GDScript, an easy-to-learn language embedded in Godot.
- **Data Storage:** User settings and progress stored locally in JSON files.
- **Design Approach:** Modular, incremental development focused on core functionality first; future enhancement is supported by flexible architecture.
